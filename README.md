# Campaign Media Planning

This project aims to solve the problem of optimizing budget allocation for advertisements. This file will contain information regarding the usage of the system, as well as the application of the MoSCoW method to the given problem.

## How to use

## MoSCoW
This section will contain all the functional and non-functional requirements considered for this system, divided into four categories: Must-have, Should-have, Could-have and Must-not-have requirements.

### Must-haves
1. The system must be able to solve the problem of budget allocation, given a set of ads, the total budget, the agency and third party fees, as well as the fixed costs for working hours.
2. The user must interact with the system through an interface in the form of a web application.
3. The user must be able to enter their own inputs, as well as configure the amount of advertisements.
4. The user must always get a definite answer regarding whether the budget allocation is possible or not, and if it is, the exact budget that can be allocated to the target advertisement.
5. The interface should be easy to use regardless of the user's experience. Therefore, it should contain clear instructions and a help page.

### Should-haves
1. The interface should employ an aesthetic look.
2. The system should be efficient enough to yield a definite result after a maximum of 1 second.

### Could-haves
1. The system's interface should have multiple implementations, including a website and a phone app.

### Must-not-haves
